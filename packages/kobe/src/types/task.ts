/**
 * Task data model — the orchestrator's unit of work.
 *
 * See DESIGN.md §2.4 ("One task ≈ one worktree ≈ one session") and §10
 * ("Data model"). The Task is a (worktree, branch, [chat tabs]) triple;
 * each chat tab owns its own Claude Code session. This module is the
 * on-disk shape for the manifest at `~/.kobe/tasks.json`.
 *
 * Multi-tab note (v2): the original v1 schema had a single `sessionId`
 * per Task (one session per task). v2 introduces `tabs: ChatTab[]` so a
 * single task (= one worktree) can host multiple independent chat
 * sessions. Same-worktree write conflicts are the user's concern;
 * kobe does not coordinate writes across tabs.
 *
 * Messages are NOT in this index. Messages live in Claude Code's JSONL
 * files; we read them via {@link AIEngine.readHistory}.
